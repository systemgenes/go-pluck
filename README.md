# go-pluck
This is an implementation to derive new data structures(sub-set) from array of structure(set).
1. Get trimmed array of structure from original array. If original array of structure contains 10 fields, then you can derive a new array(same length) of structure with only selected(say 5) fields.
2. Retrieve array of selected(only 1) element from array of structure.
